1 - What is numpy?
    Multidimensional array library

2 - Why use numpy?
    - because is faster than Lists. 
    - It uses Fixed Types, and less bytes of memory.
    - it doesn't do type checking when iterating.
    - Utilizes continuous memory.
    - Lists scatters information in blocks of memory apart from another whereas NumPy use Contiguous Memory where all blocks are next to eachother.  
    - Utilizes CPU SIMD ( Single Instruction Multiple Data ) Vector processing, for adding multiple values at one time, Efectivelly using Cache.

3 - Differences between Lists and numpy
Lists:
Insertion, deletion, appending, concatenation, etc...

NumPy: 
Same, but with extra funcionalities.
